This repository contains files I wrote while learning data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. 
I don't guarantee the code here follows best practices and is safe, it's just what I've created through the process of learning. 
If you are looking for a recommended way to implement data structures and algorithms using the C language, you can check this repository: https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C.
I don't have any goals in mind by uploading this, but I hope it encourages whoever is reading this to code something different and learn some new stuff.
Get a cookie if you read everything -> 🍪 :)
