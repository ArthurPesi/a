This repository contains files I wrote while learning data structures and algorithms using the C programming language. <br>
I don't guarantee the code here follows best practices/ is safe, it's just what I've created through the process of learning. <br>
If you are looking for a recommended way to implement data structures and algorithms using the C language, you can check this repository: https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C.<br>
I don't have any goals in mind by uploading this, but I hope it encourages whoever is reading it to code something different and learn some new stuff.<br>
Get a cookie for reading everything -> 🍪 :)
